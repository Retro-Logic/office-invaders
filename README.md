Office Invaders game is a project created by Retro Logic team for the purpose of hackaton Retro Game challenge by Code Institute. It is reincarnation of 'Space Invaders' game but gives contemporary and relevant meaning to the story. The game is designed to attract mass audience but mainly people who understand 'office life' and cannot wait for that shorthand to show 5 oâ€™clock. This is a game in which employee can finally end the office tyranny and start living again without commuting and loosing precious time.

# User Experience 


## Goals

Visitor goals

The target audience for the Office Invaders game are: 
-	Home workers who do not want to go back into the Office.
-	Office workers who wish they could work from home but their bosses are not letting them.
-	People who are fed up commuting for work every day.
-	HR and bosses who should know better.

User goals are: 
-	To easily understand storyline and game rules.

## Design Choices

Font choices
-	Primary font used for navigation on the page is [VT323](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/VT323). It is used in all areas as it is easy to read and complements retro game very well. Same font was used in all other sections to keep the same style.

Icons
-	Social Media Icons ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/)) are added on the bottom center of the game boarder page where user will be able to find further Information and history of the game. Social Media Accounts are not created but show that the user will be able to click on the icons and find further details about the game there in the future.

## Colour scheme and styling

-	Implemented palette consits of 5 colors;  #85EB40 / #F5DF7E / #B6967C / #CCDCF5 / #6C40EB. Colors that are used match retro game style from the 90's. 
-  Styling - Squared box with the bold line on the bottom were applied to make navigation separated. Buttons are clickable and will lead the user to each section on the page.

  
## Wireframes


 All wireframes are created with [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) during the Scope Plane part of the design and planning process for this project.                     It consists of 6 pages. 

- First three pages are three prototypes of how the main page should look like. 
 All three include:
- Navigation bar which consists of the Main Menu : Storyline / How to Play / Credits / Sound on/off.

- CREDITS - Consist of the Information about the game, how it was developed and inspiration for the theme.
- SOUND ON/OFF - There will be an audio implemented and will be muted when the page loads. User will be able to turn on or turn off the sound.
In the middle of the page we have name of the game OFFICE INVADERS.
- PLAY button - Will be added, user will click on it and the game will start.
- FIND US ON - Fictive part on the bottom right social platforms Icons.
- Fourth wireframe - STORYLINE - Game story and all the Information user needs to understand the theme of the game.
- Fifth wireframe consists of instructions on how to play the game, what arrow keys to use to move around and which key to press to shoot projectiles into the enemies. 
- Sixth wireframe includes credits to all the people who were part of this project.

- Second Wireframe is the one team decided to go ahead with. Social Media Icons were positioned to the center. Font and further Styling has been added.
