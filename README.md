## Design Choices

Font choices
-	Primary font used for navigation on the page is [VT323](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/VT323). It is used in all areas as it is easy to read and complements retro game very well. Same font was used in all other sections to keep the same style.

Icons
-	Social Media Icons ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/)) are added on the bottom right corner on the game boarder page where user will be able to find further Information and history of the game. Social Media Accounts are not created but show that the user will be able to click on the icons and find further details about the game there in the future.

## Colour scheme and styling

-	Colors that are used match retro game style from the 90's. Colors that are used are #85EB40 / #F5DF7E / #B6967C / #CCDCF5 / #6C40EB

## Wireframes


 All wireframes are created with [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) during the Scope Plane part of the design and planning process for this project.                     It consists of 6 pages. 

- First three pages are three prototypes of how the main page should look like. 
 All three include:
- Navigation bar which consists of the Main Menu : Storyline / How to Play / Credits / Sound on/off.

- CREDITS - Will consist of the Information about the game, how it was developed and inspiration for the theme.
- SOUND ON/OFF - There will be an audio implemented and will be muted when the page loads. User will be able to turn on or turn off the sound.
In the middle of the page we have name of the game OFFICE INVADERS and picture of the main character versus the angry HR/manager.
- PLAY button - Will be added, user will click on it and the game will start.
- FIND US ON - Fictive part on the bottom right social platforms Icons for the people who are still in early stage of the course and can work on adding icons
- Fourth wireframe - STORYLINE - Game story and all the Information user needs to understand the theme of the game.
- Fifth wireframe consists of instructions on how to play the game, what arrow keys to use to move around and which key to press to shoot projectiles into into the enemies. 
  HOW TO PLAY will bring us to the page with all the Information on how to play the game.
