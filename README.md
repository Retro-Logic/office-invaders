## Wireframes


Balsamiq was used to design all wireframes. It consists of 6 pages. 

- First three pages are three prototypes of how the main page should look like. All three include Navigation bar with main menu, storyline, how to play, credits, sound on/off and find us.
- Navigation bar is on the left hand side of the page. It consists of Main Menu : Storyline / How to Play / Credits / Sound on/off 
- STORYLINE - Game story and all the Information user needs to understand the theme of the game.
- HOW TO PLAY - This will bring us to the new page with all the Information on how to play the game. 
- CREDITS - Will consist of the Information about the game, how it was developed and inspiration for the theme.
- SOUND ON/OFF - There will be an audio implemented and will be muted when the page loads. User will be able to turn on or turn off the sound.
In the middle of the page we have name of the game OFFICE INVADERS and picture of the main character with the main weapon in his hands (mouse).
Under the photo PLAY button / button can also be inside of the picture.
- FIND US ON - Fictive part on the bottom right social platforms Icons for the people who are still in early stage of the course and can work on adding icons
