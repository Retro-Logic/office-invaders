        <h1>The story so far.</h1>
        <p>
            The year is 2020 due to the plague hitting worldwide, forcing the evil fat cats 
            to give their employees the freedom to work remotely. Life became comfy and 
            convenient for all involved, or so it seemed... 
        </p>
        <p>
            Until...
        </p>
        <p>
            ...The fog of the pandemic began to wain, fat cats the world over began to plot 
            and scheme to revoke the good life back from their employees and regain dominion 
            of their lives. Company rules, set hours, and human contact now again endangered 
            the once free programmers way of life, which was the case for many, but not all.

            Kevin would not give up the convenience of his newly bought Redbull bull fridge so 
            easily! Knowing this, the evil fat cat broke into his home and stole his precious 
            energy drinks, forcing Kevin into action!
        </p>
        <p>
            Join Kevin as he battles his way through the multiple stories of the office to gain 
            access to the executive suite on the top floor (where his Redbull fridge is locked in 
            the safe behind the big bosses desk).  Along the way, he will battle Team Leads, HR 
            managers, and even the occasional disgruntled cleaner/ canteen person/ or company 
            suck up who don't want anything to stand in the way of the return to the office.
